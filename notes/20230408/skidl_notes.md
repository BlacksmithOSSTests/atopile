# skidl notes:

## bad:
- the way components are defined and imported sucks. There's a lack of links between the footprint, schematic, symbol, spice model etc...
- the layout should be well linked to original source, so that changes propagate well without having to redo your entire layout
- it's too easy to make mistakes in the schmematic and not be able to see them
- there's no good way to visualise the circuits you're designing
- connecting a pin at a time sucks, we want busses (I know skidl has them, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
- it quickly becomes unclear what's connected to what
- unconnected components shouldn't be part of a circuit by default
## good:
- it was intuative to use - pythony, almost english descriptive
- word operators are nice
- liked being able to configure modules
