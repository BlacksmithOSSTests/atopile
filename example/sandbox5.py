# skidl notes:
# bad:
# - the way components are defined and imported sucks. There's a lack of links between the footprint, schematic, symbol, spice model etc...
# - the layout should be well linked to original source, so that changes propagate well without having to redo your entire layout
# - it's too easy to make mistakes in the schmematic and not be able to see them
# - there's no good way to visualise the circuits you're designing
# - connecting a pin at a time sucks, we want busses (I know skidl has them, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
# - it quickly becomes unclear what's connected to what
# - unconnected components shouldn't be part of a circuit by default
# good:
# - it was intuative to use - pythony, almost english descriptive
# - word operators are nice
# - liked being able to configure modules
