(@matt) add module and component types for visualizer
(@tim) layout light
don't display stubs for signals within a module
private keyword for signals
when you stub something, it's assumed to be stubbed within the module it's defined
(@matt) when you give a signal name, make sure that the net has the same name
    Gonna require some inteligence on which name takes precedence
(@matt) Where are we saving component aspects? in the graph or in a dict? 9should save in dict

collapsing modules in visualizer
symbols for stubs
labels should be inside blocks (components/modules)
symbols for blocks
improve compiler performance
