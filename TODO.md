(@matt) add module and component types for visualizer
(@tim) layout light
don't display stubs for signals within a module
private keyword for signals

(@matt) when you give a signal name, make sure that the net has the same name
    Gonna require some inteligence on which name takes precedence

symbols for stubs
labels should be inside blocks (components/modules)
symbols for blocks
